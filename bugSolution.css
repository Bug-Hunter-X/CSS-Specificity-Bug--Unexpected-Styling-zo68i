To fix the specificity issue, we can increase the specificity of the styles in the external stylesheet to override the inline styles. This can be done by adding more selectors or using the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged).  Alternatively, refactoring the HTML to avoid inline styles is often the best approach.  Below is the improved CSS file:
```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#myElement {
  color: blue !important; /* Added !important, but refactoring HTML is preferable */
}
```
